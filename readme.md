# Project Title: Pokémon GO Trainer Stat Model

## Project Goal: 
To develop a predictive model that explores the relationship between trainer level and key in-game statistics (battles won, distance walked, and Pokémon caught) in Pokémon GO, providing insights into how these stats evolve as players level up.

## Project Background:  
Driven by personal curiosity about the progression of in-game statistics in Pokémon GO, this project uses data gathered from a personal friends list to build a predictive model.  The goal is to understand how trainer level correlates with achievements like battles won, distance walked, and Pokémon caught.  This understanding can help players anticipate their own stat growth and potentially inform strategies for maximizing their in-game progress.  The project utilizes linear regression, a common statistical method, to establish these relationships, and employs data cleaning techniques to ensure model accuracy.

## Conclusion:  
The Pokémon GO Trainer Stat Model successfully demonstrates the correlation between trainer level and various in-game statistics.  By applying linear regression and rigorous data cleaning methods, the project provides a predictive tool for estimating stat growth as players progress.  The model's evaluation metrics (R-squared and MSE) offer insights into its predictive power, while the visualizations help to understand the trends between level and stats.  While the model is based on a limited dataset (friends list data), it serves as a proof-of-concept and a foundation for future expansion with larger and more diverse datasets, which would further refine the model's accuracy and generalizability.  Future iterations could also explore more advanced statistical methods or incorporate additional in-game variables to create an even more comprehensive and insightful predictive tool.
